 **NOTES/UPDATES:**
9/3/21: big_brother_data: Updated race values for contestants Jessica Graf, Josh Martinez and Ryan Lochte and fixed misspelling in "original_race_ethnicity" field name
big_brother_data_diversity: Old formula counted biracial Latinx contestants twice. New update corrects this, which affected white/poc ratios for seasons 11, 12 and 13

6/4/21: In previous versions of "big_brother_data" tallies for `total_wins` column for bbus16, bbus21 and bbus22 were mis-calulated, adding `total_nominations` to the sum. This has been corrected. Names "Steven Moses" and "Jen DiTurno" have also been corrected. Special thanks to Brannon S. for pointing these out.
